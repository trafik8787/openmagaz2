            The most brilliant cut, cut to the most exact standards. This cut optimizes light
            reflection for superior brilliance and fire with the highest polish and symmetry grade. This is an
            extremely rare cut.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade tab2">
            This is a superior cut. Reflects nearly all light entered as brilliance and fire with high
            polish and symmetry grade. A rare cut, but a more affordable option than the excellent cut.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade tab3">
            This is a high quality cut. Reflects most light entered as brilliance and fire, offering a
            beautiful diamond at an attractive value.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade tab4">
            This is an adequate cut. Reflects some light entered as brilliance and fire while maximizing
            diamond weight. A quality diamond, but not as brilliant as diamonds of higher cut grades.
