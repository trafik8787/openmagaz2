                                            You can care for your diamond jewelry with a gentle solution of mild soap and warm water. Soak your jewelry in the solution for 15 to 30 minutes and then use a soft toothbrush and gently scrub your jewelry to make it really shine. Do not scrub too hard on your jewelry pieces as this can increase the likelihood of side diamonds coming loose.
