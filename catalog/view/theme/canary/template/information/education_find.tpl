                                    <p>An engagement ring should be a reflection of the person wearing it.</p>
                                    <p>Here are a few tips to help begin:</p>
                                    <p>A woman with simpler, more streamlined taste may prefer a beautifully-made solitaire setting with one fantastic diamond. For women who like a lot of sparkle, an intricate pave setting with rows of diamonds might be preferable. A vintage setting with delicate engraving might appeal to a woman who has a penchant for the classics. Beautiful baguette side stones give a more contemporary feel to a ring, and gemstone settings are great for a woman who loves color. Tension settings will likely appeal to a more modern woman. Consider the woman, and the right style will become clear. Remember that the wedding band that will follow will need to match the engagement ring in terms of style and metal. The width of the ring is also a factor, since it will soon have a wedding ring next to it. A woman with small hands will want a narrower band on her rings, while a woman with larger hands might prefer a wider band.</p>

                                    Choosing the right metal for an engagement ring is a crucial part of the ring-design process. Once you know a bit about the basics of ring metals, deciding on a metal is a rewarding and simple process. Choosing between white gold, yellow gold, or platinum is as much as matter of personal preference as it is of budget. Before you make a final decision, it is worth weighing the pros and cons of the various types of engagement ring metals.

                                    White gold is an incredibly beautiful and popular choice for engagement ring settings, which is quickly becoming the number one choice in engagement ring metals.  offers white gold in 14K and 18K. 14K gold contains 58.5% gold, while 18K white gold is made up of 75% gold and 25% other metals (nickel, zinc, etc). White gold has the overall look of platinum, but is notably less expensive. White gold beautifully compliments diamonds that are rated D-I on the diamond color scale, as it enhances the brilliance and sparkle of the stone.

                                    White gold is typically alloyed with nickel, zinc, silver, and/or palladium to give it its white color and is often plated with rhodium—a shiny, white metal that is a member of the platinum family—to give it an even whiter appearance and protect it from color loss. Although white gold is not subject to tarnish, it may develop a slightly yellow color over time as a result of its 75% yellow gold content. If this happens, white gold’s original beauty can be restored by a simple re-plating.

                                    Even though white gold is resilient, there are important measures you can take to keep you jewelry looking as good as new. To keep white gold shiny and scratch-free, store it in a soft cloth bag or fabric-lined jewelry box. White gold should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water, using a non-metallic, soft brush (like a toothbrush). To retain white gold’s luster, make sure to keep it away from harmful and corrosive chemicals such as bleach, ammonia and chlorine. And always use a soft, lint-free cloth—never paper towels—to dry the jewelry.

                                    Yellow gold is the most common of the golds, partly because gold is yellow in its naturally occurring state. The yellow gold used in fine jewelry is typically alloyed with silver and copper; its color depends on the amount of pure gold in the alloy. The advantages of gold are that is does not corrode, tarnish or rust, so it can be counted on to provide lasting beauty. And even though it is strong, gold is more "flexible" than the other precious metals.
                                </p>

                                    Pure gold, graded 24 karats, is too soft for use in making jewelry—as a rule, the higher the karat count, the softer the gold. 18kt gold is composed of 75% gold alloyed with 25% other metals, and is used in the making of fine jewelry. 14kt gold, which is composed of 58.3% gold, is commonly used in jewelry in which strength and hardness are important factors. 10kt gold is made up of 41.7% gold, and 10 karats is the minimum amount of karats an items needs to be classified as real gold in the U.S.

                                    Platinum is a rare and valuable metal that is only found in limited quantities in a few, select regions of the world. The annual worldwide production of platinum is approximately 160 tons, compared to 1,500 tons of gold. This is why platinum is more expensive than the other precious metals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Platinum has grown increasingly popular in recent years due to its beauty and durability. Platinum’s rich, even color and sheen makes it a popular choice for engagement ring settings, as these qualities magnify the sparkle and brilliance of diamonds that are set in the metal. An added bonus of platinum’s 90-95% purity grade is that it rarely causes any allergic reaction, and is therefore the ideal metal choice for people with metal or contact allergies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Platinum is strong and can withstand a lot of stress, more so than other precious metals. It is also a naturally white metal that naturally retains its brilliant white luster naturally— white gold, on the other hand, which is mixed with alloys to give it its white appearance, loses its white shade and begins to yellow over time; white gold jewelry needs to be re-plated during its lifetime in order to maintain its white color, whereas platinum naturally retains its color. Most fine platinum jewelry uses 95% platinum, with 5% alloys. The closely-related iridium, palladium, and ruthenium are alloys that lend additional strength to platinum. In the United States, every piece of platinum jewelry sold must carry a purity stamp. "950 Plat" indicates 95% purity and "900 Plat" indicates 90% purity. In the U.S., anything less than 90% pure platinum cannot be sold as "platinum" jewelry.

                                    Maintaining the appearance of platinum is as simple as soaking the jewelry in a mild solution of soap and warm water and gently scrubbing with a soft-bristled brush. To keep platinum shiny and scratch-free, store the jewelry in its original box, a soft cloth bag, or a fabric-lined jewelry box. If platinum is worn daily, it may develop a slight sheen. Although most people prefer this look, you can always have jeweler polish platinum jewelry restore it to its original shine.

Rose gold is also known as red gold and pink gold, and sometimes as Russian gold, as a result of its popularity in Russia in the early 19th century. The difference between red, rose and pink gold is their copper content.

                                    The higher the amount of copper in gold, the more pronounced the red color. Pure gold is a deep yellow color and pure copper is reddish. The color of rose gold is somewhere on the spectrum between the two, depending on its individual composition. A common alloy for Rose gold is composed of 75% gold and 25% copper by mass.

                                    Even though gold is resilient, there are important measures you can take to keep you jewelry looking as good as new. To keep rose gold shiny and scratch-free, store it in a soft cloth bag or fabric-lined jewelry box. Rose gold should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water, using a non-metallic, soft brush (like a toothbrush). To retain rose gold’s luster, make sure to keep it away from harmful and corrosive chemicals such as bleach, ammonia and chlorine. And always use a soft, lint-free cloth—never paper towels—to dry the jewelry.

                                        If you base your diamond decision on a laboratory certificate alone, you can end up paying more. Although a certificate is useful for authenticating a diamond and providing basic specifications of a specific stone, a certificate alone doesn’t reflect the true beauty and value of a diamond. Two diamonds can be categorized as having the same characteristics on a diamond certificate, yet be priced differently, and the certificate won’t tell you why. A diamond certificate doesn’t indicate how a stone’s inclusions affect its beauty and value. You need to actually see a diamond to understand the nature of its inclusions.

                                    <p>
                                        Cut refers to the diamond’s proportion and facets. Shape is the overall geometric form of the stone (e.g. round, square, oval). A diamond’s cut and shape affect many aspects of the stone’s overall appearance and price; cut can be graded, whereas shape cannot. Experts say cut is the most important buying criteria, because it determines the diamond’s sparkle and brilliance, and recommend buying the best possible cut that you can afford.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Diamond shape is a very personal choice and you should go with the shape you like best. If you decide on a shape and cut first, it will be easier to decide on the other C’s. Choosing a cut and shape you love will save you money in the long run, as you’ll be less inclined to change your ring or upgrade down the line.

                                        Choose a Diamond With a Clarity and Color Grade that Looks "Clean" to the Naked Eye
                                    </div>
                                    <p>
                                        When it comes to white (non-fancy) diamonds, most consumers can't tell the difference between diamonds on the very high end of the clarity scale ( like VVS1), and those lower on the scale which contain very slight or slight inclusions (VS1 or SI1). In the case of many SI1 diamonds, for example, the flaws are only visible under 10X magnification, although the price difference between a VVS1 and an SI1 diamond is considerable.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Keep in mind that some diamond cuts, such as the popular round cut, mask inclusions and flaws very well. So if you're on a budget, you don’t necessarily need to buy an internally flawless diamond. A lower-clarity stone that looks clear to the naked eye is probably sufficient.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The same advice applies to a diamond’s Color Grade. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA), the American Gem Society (AGS), and the International Gemological Institute (IGI) grade a diamond’s color on a scale of D (colorless, and most desirable) to Z (least desirable, with a visible yellow tint).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A "D" or "F" diamond (colorless) can easily cost double that of an “I” (near colorless) diamond of the same cut, although most people can’t tell the difference between the two. If you’re on a budget, use your eyes as a guide. You don't need to buy a diamond that's on the highest end of the color scale. With ’s Diamond Display Technology, you can view a magnified version of the actual diamonds on our website in high-definition which shows you the true and exact characteristics of the stone, to help you make an informed buying decision.

                                        Although platinum is the preferred ring metal of choice, it is also the most expensive of the precious metals used in jewelry. White gold, on the other hand, is an excellent and affordable alternative to platinum and a great choice for the budget conscious shopper. White gold has a stunning appearance and a white/gray patina that resembles platinum. White gold is also very durable, has a high scratch resistance factor, and does an excellent job of drawing attention to a diamond’s brilliance.

Please read our diamond education, as well as "How to Choose the Perfect Diamond," to learn about each attribute in detail and what diamond grade offers the best value for your budget.

                                        Engagement rings are typically made from one of three metals: platinum, white gold, or yellow gold. Platinum is the most expensive metal as it resists tarnishing, but it is also the most expensive to repair if damaged.

                                        Yellow gold rings are the most popular and are available in 14-karat or 18-karat gold. Although this type of ring can show scratches and other abrasions, repairs come easy.

                                        White gold rings have a silver-like appearance which will eventually wear off and need to be replaced. The appeal of white gold is that it easily matches most other jewelry.

                                    When a ring style is ordered, different metal components are ordered to the specifications of the desired ring. Those components are pieced together and cut to size. We either solder or laser the metal to weld it to accommodate the proper center stone and finger size. Since platinum requires such high heat, it is always welded by laser.
                                </p>

                                    Next, the rings go through a series of polishing stages to prepare them for stone setting. Diamonds and gem stones are picked to the specifications of the style, accurate to the .01mm. Color, clarity, and cut of each accenting diamond or gem stone is double checked.

                                    Classic wedding rings are the perfect choice for newly engaged couples in the market for traditional, timeless rings. Like most bridal jewelry, classic wedding rings come in yellow gold, white gold and platinum. Rings are sold in a variety of widths, ranging from 2mm to 8mm.  carries slightly domed comfort fit wedding rings, slightly flat comfort fit wedding rings, flat comfort fit wedding rings, high dome comfort fit wedding rings, low dome wedding rings, traditional slightly curved wedding rings and classic comfort fit wedding rings.

                                    Classic wedding rings are known for their comfort, as opposed to more intricate or carved wedding rings. Unlike engagement rings, both men and women wear wedding rings all the time and therefore it is extremely important that they are comfortable for every day wear.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When selecting classic wedding rings, understanding width is also critical. The width of your wedding ring is entirely a matter of personal style. Some men and women prefer wider bands while others prefer narrower bands. The width of a woman's wedding ring, specifically, depends entirely on the width of the band on her engagement ring. If a woman with small hands already has a large, wide engagement ring, choosing a narrower band for her wedding ring is a better choice for her comfort. A woman with larger hands can handle wider bands on both engagement and wedding rings, but might prefer not to. Women's wedding rings traditionally match their engagement rings in some way, but they can be very different widths and look beautiful together.

                                    Women’s carved wedding bands are a popular choice for women who prefer a twist on the classic wedding ring.

Women with simple or understated engagement rings, often choose to wear intricate carved wedding rings. Carved wedding rings, however, also look striking next to flashy or engagement rings.

                                    Titanium rings are very popular, particularly as a men’s wedding ring. Titanium is very durable, lightweight and hypoallergenic, making it a great choice for anyone who suffers from metal allergies. Titanium’s color is slightly darker than that of white gold or platinum. Because of its durability, titanium is usually machined from a single piece of metal (which is why it cannot be used for engagement ring prongs, for example). Titanium rings offer many finishes, such as a brushed finished, a polished finished and a hammered finish.

                                    Cobalt chrome is an alloy which is made of cobalt and chromium. The major advantages of cobalt chrome are that it is difficult for it to corrode, scratch or chip. Simultaneously, cobalt chrome is also very malleable, making it very easy to work with. Finally, cobalt chrome is hypoallergenic, making it a wonderful option for anyone who has sensitive skin.

                                    Ceramic rings have become more prevalent because of their durability, affordability and wide range of colors. The most popular ceramic wedding ring color is black, offering a sleek and unique look for a wedding band. Ceramic jewelry is also very versatile, as it can be customized into a variety of shapes and sizes.

                                    Every bride has an idea of what ring she wants and, if possible, the ring that he'll be wearing too. If your man is hesitant about wearing a ring, then put aside your plans for matching bands. Though having rings that match can be a wonderful public expression of your love for each other, that shouldn't be a critical point. Many men find rings to be uncomfortable, so if your platinum round pave set diamond wedding ring doesn't come in an equivalent ring for him, don't fret - wear the ring you want and let him pick out the ring that he likes.
                                </p>

                                    Styles of rings vary from the traditional to the contemporary, with many women choosing to blend both. Fashion designers such as M Danhov understand what brides want and that includes diamonds - lots of them! For example, the Ladies 18k White Gold MY4 by Danhov Diamond Wedding Band represents the ultimate wedding band: four rows of 2.15 carats of pave' set diamonds in white gold. Stunningly elegant, yet amazingly refined, rings from the Danhov Collection are admired and desired worldwide.

                                    Men have many choices too when it comes to wedding bands. The rules have changed to the point where any man, if he likes them, can have a wedding ring that is encrusted in diamonds too. A customized ring can be made that fits his personality and, if your are one lucky woman, match your ring too. One special note: many men prefer comfort-fit rings, those wedding bands which have rounded inner edges to them.

                                    On-line ring buying has grown in leaps and bounds because consumers have discovered that they can get the same rings through mail order that they can buy at the local jewelry store. Because retailers like  have a small overhead, the savings are passed on to the customer in the form of lower prices. Moreover, in many cases on-line purchases are delivered state tax free, translating into additional savings for the happy couple. That ring selling for $6000 at the mall jewelry shop could retail for under $5000 on-line!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    No matter where you choose to buy your wedding rings, finding a pair that satisfies you both is very important. Your wedding day is a once in a lifetime event, and a day you'll want to cherish forever. Find the right pair of rings and you'll have a forever reminder of your commitment to each other, rings that will satisfy both husband and wife.

                                        Blue sapphire is considered a primary color gemstone; the purer the primary hue, the more valuable the gemstone. Blue sapphires are colored by trace amounts of titanium and iron. (By increasing the level of titanium and iron the color saturation is also increased.) The most common secondary hues found in blue sapphires are purple, violet, and green. Violet and purple can contribute to the overall beauty of the color, while green is considered to be the bane of a blue sapphire. The problem is that all blue sapphires will have a greenish component when viewed at the right angle. It is the cutter that makes sure that the green is not part of the face up position in a sapphire. When gray is included in the overall color of the gemstone, often referred to as a gray mask, the sapphire will have a cool or steely quality as opposed to the normal warm velvety hue of a sapphire. Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in blue sapphires and will often mix with green.

                                        Blue sapphires that are eye-clean or entirely free of inclusions are uncommon, especially in larger sizes. However, blue sapphires with some internal inclusions are still highly valued, as long as the inclusions do not reduce brilliance, obscure color, or otherwise detract from the gemstone’s beauty. Blue sapphires of one-carat weight or more are not usually cut to calibrated sizes or standard shapes. Each gemstone is shaped to maximize the color and weight of the gemstone.

                                        In blue sapphires, cutting can influence color in surprising ways. Sapphires are dichroic gemstone, meaning their color varies depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Viewed in one direction, most blue sapphires appear blue to violet-blue. From another direction, they will appear slightly greenish blue. A skilled cutter will orient their gemstone so that the blue to violet-blue color shows through the finished gem’s crown.

                                        Silk inclusions are also acceptable in blue sapphires, as long as they are not so dense as to compromise color or brilliance. In fact, silk inclusions can increase the value of a sapphire. The heat treatments used to alter color and clarity in blue sapphires break down rutile silk, so the presence of intact silk indicates that a sapphire is unheated. Certain other solid and liquid inclusions burst or deform under extreme heat and are also useful indicators of heat treatment.

                                        Green emerald is considered a primary color gemstone; the purer the primary hue, the more valuable the gemstone. Blue sapphires are colored by trace amounts of titanium and iron. (By increasing the level of titanium and iron the color saturation is also increased.) The most common secondary hues found in blue sapphires are purple, violet, and green. Violet and purple can contribute to the overall beauty of the color, while green is considered to be the bane of a blue sapphire. The problem is that all blue sapphires will have a greenish component when viewed at the right angle. It is the cutter that makes sure that the green is not part of the face up position in a sapphire. When gray is included in the overall color of the gemstone, often referred to as a gray mask, the sapphire will have a cool or steely quality as opposed to the normal warm velvety hue of a sapphire. Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in blue sapphires and will often mix with green.

                                        Green emerald that are eye-clean or entirely free of inclusions are uncommon, especially in larger sizes. However, blue sapphires with some internal inclusions are still highly valued, as long as the inclusions do not reduce brilliance, obscure color, or otherwise detract from the gemstone’s beauty. Blue sapphires of one-carat weight or more are not usually cut to calibrated sizes or standard shapes. Each gemstone is shaped to maximize the color and weight of the gemstone.

                                    <p>
                                        In green emerald, cutting can influence color in surprising ways. Sapphires are dichroic gemstone, meaning their color varies depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Viewed in one direction, most blue sapphires appear blue to violet-blue. From another direction, they will appear slightly greenish blue. A skilled cutter will orient their gemstone so that the blue to violet-blue color shows through the finished gem’s crown.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Silk inclusions are also acceptable in blue sapphires, as long as they are not so dense as to compromise color or brilliance. In fact, silk inclusions can increase the value of a sapphire. The heat treatments used to alter color and clarity in blue sapphires break down rutile silk, so the presence of intact silk indicates that a sapphire is unheated. Certain other solid and liquid inclusions burst or deform under extreme heat and are also useful indicators of heat treatment.

                                            When selecting your perfect diamond, take the time to consider the 4Cs and determine what is the most important factors in a diamond for you. The 4Cs consist of: Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat Weight.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <b>Cut:</b>  A diamond’s cut is the most important characteristic in determining a diamond’s beauty. The cut of a diamond refers not to its visual shape, but its ability to properly reflect light. A diamond cut to the highest standards of proportion, provides the most beauty and sparkle.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <b>Color:</b>  A diamond’s color grade is based on a diamond’s lack of color. The color scale ranges from D to Z, with D being absolutely colorless and Z being light yellow in color. The higher the color grade, the higher the value of the diamond because of the rarity of the stone.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <b>Clarity:</b> The clarity of a diamond describes how clear a diamond looks. Clarity is judged by small, naturally occurring imperfections in a diamond known as clarity characteristics. These size and number of these characteristics can effect a diamonds clarity grade and overall beauty.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <b>Carat Weight:</b>  Carat is the most visible characteristic of a diamond and refers to the measure of a diamond’s weight. Diamonds with a higher carat weight are always more valuable, because they are found in nature much less often than smaller diamonds. Diamond prices increase substantially as the carat weight increases.
                                        </p>

                                            Symmetry refers to the exactness of the shape and arrangement of facets in a diamond. Although to the naked eye finish features only have a tiny effect on appearance, symmetry is significant. In diamonds that have low clarity grades, symmetry is less important, but in diamonds with very high clarity grades, symmetry is very important.

                                                The Emerald-Cut Diamond is a very popular style known for its beauty and precision. While it lacks the brilliance of diamonds cut with triangular and kite-shaped facets, it more than makes up for it in its extreme clarity – it’s like looking into glacier-pure ice. The Emerald-Cut diamond is named so because this style of cut was originally used only on emeralds.

                                            Diamond polish influences how well light is able to pass through a diamond. It is a very important attribute in determining a diamond's overall brilliance. When choosing a diamond, it is best to pick one that is laboratory certified with good, very good or excellent polish. Diamonds with poor polish are significantly less brilliant because they have microscopic polish lines that blur the surface of the stone—this also reduces the amount of light that enters or exits the diamond. Be aware that many diamonds have a poor polish because some diamond cutters reduce their costs by not spending sufficient time to properly polish a diamond.

                                        <p>
                                            Polish is graded the same that way symmetry is graded. On a GIA report, the grades are Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor. The same applies for AGS and IGI reports, which also include ideal in their lisThere is very little difference between these ratings to the unaided eye. A diamond with a polish rating of Good can still be a remarkable stone. It is only under magnification that the differences in these ratings become clearer. Polish rated Fair (FR) and Poor (PR), however, indicates that the flaws in the polish are visible to the naked eye and affect the overall beauty of the diamond.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It is also important that your ring does not have a porosity problem or rough spots in the metal. Porosity is when there are little surface holes that get worse as you go deeper into the metal. Generally the result of mass producing rings with poor quality control, porosity makes a ring weak and is non-repairable. A ring with porosity will eventually break down.

                                            The Round Diamond, or Brilliant Cut Diamond, is by far the most popular shape for diamond engagement rings. It is cone-shaped to maximize light return through the top of the diamond. It is cut to have 58 facets: 33 on the crown and 25 on the pavilion. The relationship between the angle of the crown (above the girdle) and the pavilion (below the girdle) is complementary. A steep crown angle is complemented by a shallower pavilion angle, and vice versa.

                                            The Princess cut diamonds can make the perfect engagement rings since they are very clear. Their exquisite shape makes them an exotic treasure, as they are designed for getting top brilliance from their square cut. When purchasing a Princess Cut diamond, make sure that the setting for your ring protects the four pointed corners. The Princess Cut diamond allows more acceptably for flaws.

                                            The Emerald-Cut Diamond is a very popular style known for its beauty and precision. While it lacks the brilliance of diamonds cut with triangular and kite-shaped facets, it more than makes up for it in its extreme clarity – it’s like looking into glacier-pure ice. The Emerald-Cut diamond is named so because this style of cut was originally used only on emeralds. It is called a step-cut, which is the cut most commonly used on square or rectangular diamonds.

                                            The Pear Shaped Diamond combines the tradition and brilliance of a round cut with a less common shape to create an unusual diamond that can still make light 'dance' as it does in the traditional Round Brilliant Cut. It is probably the most subjective diamond shape, as its size and proportions are really a matter of taste. The diamond usually contains 58 facets, allowing for light to pass through it much the same way as in a Round, but makes more of an impression because of its much less common shape.

                                            The Radiant Cut Diamond combines the more stylish square or rectangular shape with the brilliance of the more traditional Round Cut. It combines two diamond cutting styles-the Round Cut style and the Emerald Cut style, to create a non-traditional, yet still brilliant, diamond. This cut, created in 1977 by Henry Grossbard, was designed to maintain the beauty of each different type of diamond, while still creating something altogether different from anything available at the time.

                                            The Marquise-Cut Diamond is a boat-shaped brilliant stone that is considered to be a "classic" shape for diamond engagement rings. As with all 'fancy cut' diamonds, color and clarity are the two most important qualities in this particular style of cut. The Marquise-Cut Diamond uses a cutting process similar to that of a Round Brilliant Diamond, but the diamond cutter maximizes the carat weight of the gem by elongating it into its distinctive ''boat-shape''. This way, they can eliminate all inclusions while maintaining as much of the unblemished stone as possible. However, because of the elongated shape, color and clarity imperfections are more obvious than they are in a traditional Round Brilliant Diamonds.

                                            The Cushion Cut Diamond is an antique cut that has a classic, romantic appeal. It is considered a cross between the Old Mine Cut, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and a modern Oval-Cut Diamond. The Old Mine Cut featured large facets and rounded corners, since the cutting was all done by hand at the time. They were designed to catch the beauty of candlelight. The Cushion-Cut Diamond contains 58 facets.

                                            The Heart Shaped Diamond has a cleft at the top and exhibits superior brilliance. It is among the most romantic of the diamond shapes. When selecting a heart shaped diamond, symmetry is essential, as the two halves of the heart must be identical. The split between the two lobes should be obvious and sharp, and the wings should have a round shape. Generally, heart shapes diamonds of less than .50 carats are not a good choice. As opposed to other diamond shapes, they appear smaller, especially after set in prongs. Bezel and three prong settings are best for small heart shaped diamonds.

                                            The Oval Cut Diamond is a modified version of the most popular cut, the Round Brilliant. It is the perfect choice for buyers who are looking for characteristics similar to the Round "Ideal" Cut, but would like something in a shape that is more unusual. Oval Cut diamonds also create the optical illusion of length and serve to elegantly elongate fingers.

                                            The Asscher Cut Diamond, also called a "Square Emerald-Cut", is made using a step-cut process and has cropped corners. Because of the cropped corners, an Asscher Cut Diamond appears almost octagonal at first glance. They are bright, shiny, and clear in appearance. Like Emerald-Cut Diamonds, they have the clarity of glacier-water ice, allowing you to see all the way through the stone. However, since inclusions are obvious to the naked eye with Asscher Cut Diamonds, it is important to get one that is flawless or as close to flawless as possible.

                                                    A diamond certificate verifies each diamond’s specifications, including its color grade, carat weight, clarity grade and cut grade. You should never buy a diamond without a diamond certificate. The most well-known grading laboratories are the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the American Gem Society (AGS) and the International Gemological Institute (IGI).

                                                    A diamond's cost depends upon objective characteristics popularly known as the 4C's: Color, Clarity, Cut and Carat. The relationship between these four characteristics determines the value of a diamond. Although it is commonly assumed that carat is the most important member of the 4C's, color, cut and clarity have a much greater impact on the appearance of a diamond.

The most well-known grading laboratories are the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the American Gem Society (AGS) and the International Gemological Institute (IGI).

                                                    A diamond's cost depends upon objective characteristics popularly known as the 4C's: Color, Clarity, Cut and Carat. The relationship between these four characteristics determines the value of a diamond. Although it is commonly assumed that carat is the most important member of the 4C's, color, cut and clarity have a much greater impact on the appearance of a diamond.

                                                    Conflict-free diamonds are those gems which were not obtained in association with human rights abuses, child labor, violence, or environmental degradation. Although the United Nation’s Kimberley Process only covers diamonds under the control of legitimate and recognized governments, conflict-free goes one step further by rejecting diamonds from governments that trade in diamonds to bankroll their conflicts. Throughout the 1990s, most of the world's diamonds came from Africa, particularly regions undergoing civil unrest. Rebel armies in parts of Africa were exploiting alluvial diamond fields to fund their wars against established governments, putting people and the environment in the middle of their conflicts. Alluvial diamonds are found just inches to a few feet below the surface, making them easier to mine, but having an adverse impact on the environment. The people working these fields were often very young and subject to exploitation, with some losing their lives or becoming permanently maimed as wars raged around them. Hence, the term blood diamonds came into being to describe these types of gems.

                                                    The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) was established to certify the origin of rough diamonds from sources known to be conflict-free. A 2000 meeting of southern African diamond producing countries established guidelines for the KPCS, which were later adopted by the United Nations. To ensure compliance, independent auditing systems are tasked with tracking diamonds from their place of origin to delivery. Polished diamonds sold in the U.S. must adhere to the Patriot Act which requires that every U.S. dealer maintain Kimberley compliance or be subject to penalties from Homeland Security, the U.S. Justice Department, and the U.S. Treasury.

                                                A diamond’s cut is the most important characteristic in determining a diamond’s beauty. The cut of a diamond refers not to its visual shape, but its ability to properly reflect light. A diamond cut to the highest standards of proportion, provides the most beauty and sparkle. A diamond’s cut grade is determined by three types of reflected light, brilliance, fire and scintillation.

                                                <b>Scintillation:</b> Scintillation refers to the flashes of contrasting light and dark areas in a diamond when it moves, resulting in sparkle.

                                                If cut to ideal proportions, these three factors create an exceptionally beautiful diamond. The cut of a diamond is judged on the balance of symmetry, polish and proportions. The proportions of a diamonds table size, crown, girdle, pavilion and culet all contribute to how light will be reflected and seen by the eye. When cut to ideal proportions, light enters the top of the stone and is reflected back through the crown, providing the diamond with the maximum amount of brilliance. If cut too deep or too shallow, light will escape out the pavilion known as light leakage. This results in a less brilliant diamond that can appear darker in color.

                                                <p class="text-left">Through the years, modern diamond cutters have learned the perfect proportions and angles that allow diamonds to reflect light and produce the most sparkle and brilliance. Cut grades have been established to help you recognize a well-cut diamond.</p>

                                            Carat is the most visible characteristic of a diamond and refers to the measure of a diamond’s weight. However, carat weight may not accurately reflect a diamond’s visual size depending on other factors. When determining a diamond’s size, many factors need to be considered.
                                            <br>
                                            Carat is only a measurement of weight, not of visual size. Depending on the shape and cut of the diamond, the weight can be shown differently. For example, a 1.00ct round diamond measuring 6.5mm x 6.5mm compared to a 1.00ct marquise cut diamond measuring 10.5mm x 5mm, the marquise cut diamond will give the visual appearance of being larger because of its long proportions.

                                            Diamonds with a higher carat weight are always more valuable, because they are found in nature much less often than smaller diamonds. Diamond prices increase substantially as the carat weight increases.

                                            “Magic Numbers” refer to carat weights that are highly desirable in the industry. This includes 0.50ct, 0.75ct, 1.00ct, 1.50ct, 2.00ct, 2.50ct, 3.00ct and so on. Prices increase when that “magic number” is hit. You can find a better value if you get a diamond right under a “magic number.” In doing this, you can save a substantial amount of money without sacrificing the look you want.

                                    Depending on the setting you choose, you can soak your diamond engagement and/or wedding rings for up to 30 minutes in a solution of dishwashing liquid and water. This is best suited to prong and cathedral settings. In pave and basket settings, however, soaking the rings can increase the likelihood of the gems coming loose. Be mindful of this when you decide to soak any jewelry piece use mild dish soap in warm water and soak your jewelry for a few minutes. Using a soft cloth or cotton swab, gently scrub the metal (gold, platinum, silver) and then rinse. Repeat the process if necessary, but always proceed with caution when it comes to soaking jewelry.

                                    For extra shine, you can soak diamonds in window cleaner afterwards. Because glass cleaner contains some harsh chemicals, do not soak for more than a minute at a time, and do not use this process at all with rhodium. To ensure that all of the glass cleaner is rinsed off, use the same mild dish soap solution. Dip your ring into the solution, rinse it with warm water, and then dry it completely.

                                    You can use toothpicks to remove dirt that is lodged in between the prongs and the diamonds, but be extra careful not to scratch the metal or move the positioning of a prong. If fibers from cloth get stuck in the setting, gently use tweezers to remove them. Again, be careful of the metal. Even though diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds, the precious metals into which they are set can be scratched more easily.

                                    Ionic cleaners can be used on most diamond jewelry. If your engagement ring is set with stones other than diamonds, consider other cleaning methods, as some gemstones are adversely affected by the electrical current in the ionic cleaning process.
